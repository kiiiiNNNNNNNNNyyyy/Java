                                        Encapsulation is the mechanism that binds together the code and the data it manipulates, and keeps both safe from
                                        outside interference and misuse. Access to the code and the data inside the wrapper is tightly controlled through a well defined
                                        interface. When you create a class, you will specify the code and the data that constitutes the class. Collectively, these elements
                                        are called the members of the class.

                                    Inheritance is the process by which one object acquires the properties of another object. It supports the concept of hierarhical 
                                    classification. Inheritance interacts with encapsulation as well. If a given class encapsulates some attributes, then any
                                    subclass will have the same attributes plus any that it adds as part of its specialization. Aa new subclass inherits all the 
                                    attribute of its ancestor.

                                    A class is a template for an object, and an object is an instance of a class. Because an object is an instance of a class,

                                Objects are dynamically created in java by using the 'new' operator. Java handles deallocation autommmatically. Where no references to an object exists, that object is assumed to be no longer needed, and the memory occupied by the pobject can be used. There is no explicit need to destroy the objects as in C++.

                                Sometimes an object will no need to perform some action when it is destroyed. For eg, if an object is holding some non-java resources such as a file handle or character font, then you might want to make sure these resources are freed before an object is destroyed. To handle such situations, java provides a mechanism called finalization. By using finalization, you can define specific actions that will occur when the object's memory is just about to be reclaimed by the garbage collector.

                                The most important thing to remember about strings in java is that strings are immutable. Once a String object is created,  its content cannot be altered. To alter Strings, Java defines peer classes of String, called StringBuffer and StringBuilder, which allows strings to be altered. Both these classes are available in java.lang package. All three (String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder) implements the CharSequence interface.

                            throws and finally.

                            Exceptions of this type are automatically defined for the programs that you write and include things such as division by zero.

                            errors having to do with the run time environment, itself.
